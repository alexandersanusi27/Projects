# Networking Project â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer

## Overview
This project involved designing, configuring, and securing a simulated network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of my second-year Networks module at MMU.

## Objectives
- Build and configure a small network topology with routers, switches, and hosts.
- Implement IP addressing, VLANs, and basic routing.
- Analyse network traffic using Wireshark and verify correct communication between hosts.
- Perform a vulnerability scan with Nmap and recommend mitigations.

## Tools Used
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Wireshark  
- Nmap  

## Key Learning Outcomes
- Practical experience designing and troubleshooting network topologies.
- Hands-on exposure to network analysis and vulnerability scanning.
- Produced a written report with recommendations to improve network security.
